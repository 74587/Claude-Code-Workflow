# üöÄ Claude Code Workflow (CCW) - Getting Started Guide

Welcome to Claude Code Workflow (CCW)! This guide will help you get up and running in 5 minutes and experience AI-driven automated software development.

---

## ‚è±Ô∏è 5-Minute Quick Start

Let's build a "Hello World" web application from scratch with a simple example.

### Step 1: Install CCW

First, make sure you have installed CCW according to the [Installation Guide](INSTALL.md).

### Step 2: Start a Workflow Session

Think of a "session" as a dedicated project folder. CCW will store all files related to your current task here.

```bash
/workflow:session:start "My First Web App"
```

You will see that the system has created a new session, for example, `WFS-my-first-web-app`.

### Step 3: Create an Execution Plan

Now, tell CCW what you want to do. CCW will analyze your request and automatically generate a detailed, executable task plan.

```bash
/workflow:plan "Create a simple Express API that returns Hello World at the root path"
```

This command kicks off a fully automated planning process, which includes:
1.  **Context Gathering**: Analyzing your project environment.
2.  **Agent Analysis**: AI agents think about the best implementation path.
3.  **Task Generation**: Creating specific task files (in `.json` format).

### Step 4: Execute the Plan

Once the plan is created, you can command the AI agents to start working.

```bash
/workflow:execute
```

You will see CCW's agents (like `@code-developer`) begin to execute tasks one by one. It will automatically create files, write code, and install dependencies.

### Step 5: Check the Status

Want to know the progress? You can check the status of the current workflow at any time.

```bash
/workflow:status
```

This will show the completion status of tasks, the currently executing task, and the next steps.

## üß† Core Concepts Explained

Understanding these concepts will help you use CCW more effectively:

-   **Workflow Session**
    > Like an independent sandbox or project space, used to isolate the context, files, and history of different tasks. All related files are stored in the `.workflow/WFS-<session-name>/` directory.

-   **Task**
    > An atomic unit of work, such as "create API route" or "write test case." Each task is a `.json` file that defines the goal, context, and execution steps in detail.

-   **Agent**
    > An AI assistant specialized in a specific domain. For example:
    > -   `@code-developer`: Responsible for writing and implementing code.
    > -   `@test-fix-agent`: Responsible for running tests and automatically fixing failures.
    > -   `@ui-design-agent`: Responsible for UI design and prototype creation.

-   **Workflow**
    > A series of predefined, collaborative commands used to orchestrate different agents and tools to achieve a complex development goal (e.g., `plan`, `execute`, `test-gen`).

## üõ†Ô∏è Common Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Developing a New Feature (as shown above)

This is the most common use case, following the "start session ‚Üí plan ‚Üí execute" pattern.

```bash
# 1. Start a session
/workflow:session:start "User Login Feature"

# 2. Create a plan
/workflow:plan "Implement JWT-based user login and registration"

# 3. Execute
/workflow:execute
```

### Scenario 2: UI Design

CCW has powerful UI design capabilities, capable of generating complex UI prototypes from simple text descriptions.

```bash
# 1. Start a UI design workflow
/workflow:ui-design:explore-auto --prompt "A modern, clean admin dashboard login page with username, password fields and a login button"

# 2. View the generated prototype
# After the command finishes, it will provide a path to a compare.html file. Open it in your browser to preview.
```

### Scenario 3: Fixing a Bug

CCW can help you analyze and fix bugs.

```bash
# 1. Use the bug-index command to analyze the problem
/cli:mode:bug-index "Incorrect success message even with wrong password on login"

# 2. The AI will analyze the relevant code and generate a fix plan. You can then execute this plan.
/workflow:execute
```

## üîß Workflow-Free Usage: Standalone Tools

Beyond the full workflow mode, CCW provides standalone CLI tools and commands suitable for quick analysis, ad-hoc queries, and routine maintenance tasks.

### Direct CLI Tool Invocation

CCW supports direct invocation of external AI tools (Gemini, Qwen, Codex) through a unified CLI interface without creating workflow sessions.

#### Code Analysis

Quickly analyze project code structure and architectural patterns:

```bash
# Code analysis with Gemini
/cli:analyze --tool gemini "Analyze authentication module architecture"

# Code quality analysis with Qwen
/cli:analyze --tool qwen "Review database model design for best practices"
```

#### Interactive Chat

Direct interactive dialogue with AI tools:

```bash
# Chat with Gemini
/cli:chat --tool gemini "Explain React Hook use cases"

# Discuss implementation with Codex
/cli:chat --tool codex "How to optimize this query performance"
```

#### Specialized Analysis Modes

Use specific analysis modes for in-depth exploration:

```bash
# Architecture planning mode
/cli:mode:plan --tool gemini "Design a scalable microservices architecture"

# Deep code analysis
/cli:mode:code-analysis --tool qwen "Analyze utility functions in src/utils/"

# Bug analysis mode
/cli:mode:bug-index --tool gemini "Analyze potential causes of memory leak"
```

### Semantic Tool Invocation

Users can tell Claude to use specific tools through natural language, and Claude will understand the intent and automatically execute the appropriate commands.

#### Semantic Invocation Examples

Describe needs directly in conversation using natural language:

**Example 1: Code Analysis**
```
User: "Use gemini to analyze the modular architecture of this project"
‚Üí Claude will automatically execute gemini-wrapper for analysis
```

**Example 2: Document Generation**
```
User: "Use gemini to generate API documentation with all endpoint descriptions"
‚Üí Claude will understand the need and automatically invoke gemini's write mode
```

**Example 3: Code Implementation**
```
User: "Use codex to implement user login functionality"
‚Üí Claude will invoke the codex tool for autonomous development
```

#### Advantages of Semantic Invocation

- **Natural Interaction**: No need to memorize complex command syntax
- **Intelligent Understanding**: Claude selects appropriate tools and parameters based on context
- **Automatic Optimization**: Claude automatically adds necessary context and configuration

### Direct Gemini Wrapper Script Usage

For scenarios requiring precise control, the Gemini Wrapper script can be used directly.

#### Basic Analysis (Read-only Mode)

By default, Gemini runs in read-only mode, suitable for code exploration and architectural analysis:

```bash
# Execute analysis in project root
cd /path/to/project && ~/.claude/scripts/gemini-wrapper -p "
PURPOSE: Analyze project modular architecture
TASK: Identify core modules and their dependencies
CONTEXT: @{src/**/*.ts,CLAUDE.md}
EXPECTED: Generate architecture diagram and module documentation
RULES: Focus on module boundaries and interface design
"
```

#### Document Generation (Write Mode)

When file generation or modification is needed, write mode must be explicitly enabled:

```bash
# Generate API documentation
cd /path/to/project && ~/.claude/scripts/gemini-wrapper --approval-mode yolo -p "
PURPOSE: Generate REST API documentation
TASK: Extract API endpoints from code and generate Markdown docs
MODE: write
CONTEXT: @{src/api/**/*.ts}
EXPECTED: Generate API.md with all endpoint descriptions
RULES: Follow OpenAPI specification format
"
```

#### Context Optimization Techniques

Using `cd` to switch to specific directories optimizes context scope:

```bash
# Analyze only auth module
cd src/auth && ~/.claude/scripts/gemini-wrapper -p "
PURPOSE: Security review of authentication module
TASK: Check JWT implementation and password handling
CONTEXT: @{**/*.ts}
EXPECTED: Security audit report
RULES: Focus on OWASP Top 10 security issues
"
```

### Memory Management: CLAUDE.md Updates

CCW uses a hierarchical CLAUDE.md documentation system to maintain project context. Regular updates to these documents are critical for ensuring high-quality AI outputs.

#### Full Project Index Rebuild

Suitable for large-scale refactoring, architectural changes, or first-time CCW usage:

```bash
# Rebuild entire project documentation index
/update-memory-full

# Use specific tool for indexing
/update-memory-full --tool gemini   # Comprehensive analysis (recommended)
/update-memory-full --tool qwen     # Architecture focus
/update-memory-full --tool codex    # Implementation details
```

**When to Execute**:
- During project initialization
- After major architectural changes
- Weekly routine maintenance
- When AI output drift is detected

#### Incremental Related Module Updates

Suitable for daily development, updating only modules affected by changes:

```bash
# Update recently modified related documentation
/update-memory-related

# Specify tool for update
/update-memory-related --tool gemini
```

**When to Execute**:
- After feature development completion
- After module refactoring
- After API interface updates
- After data model modifications

#### Memory Quality Impact

| Update Frequency | Result |
|-----------------|--------|
| ‚ùå Never update | Outdated API references, incorrect architectural assumptions, low-quality output |
| ‚ö†Ô∏è Occasional updates | Partial context accuracy, potential inconsistencies |
| ‚úÖ Timely updates | High-quality output, precise context, correct pattern references |

### CLI Tool Initialization

When using external CLI tools for the first time, initialization commands provide quick configuration:

```bash
# Auto-configure all tools
/cli:cli-init

# Configure specific tools only
/cli:cli-init --tool gemini
/cli:cli-init --tool qwen
```

This command will:
- Analyze project structure
- Generate tool configuration files
- Set up `.geminiignore` / `.qwenignore`
- Create context file references

## ‚ùì Troubleshooting

-   **Problem: Prompt shows "No active session found"**
    > **Reason**: You haven't started a workflow session, or the current session is complete.
    > **Solution**: Use `/workflow:session:start "Your task description"` to start a new session.

-   **Problem: Command execution fails or gets stuck**
    > **Reason**: It could be a network issue, AI model limitation, or the task is too complex.
    > **Solution**:
    > 1.  First, try using `/workflow:status` to check the current state.
    > 2.  Check the log files in the `.workflow/WFS-<session-name>/.chat/` directory for detailed error messages.
    > 3.  If the task is too complex, try breaking it down into smaller tasks and then use `/workflow:plan` to create a new plan.

## üìö Next Steps for Advanced Learning

Once you've mastered the basics, you can explore CCW's more powerful features:

1.  **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**: Use `/workflow:tdd-plan` to create a complete TDD workflow. The AI will first write failing tests, then write code to make them pass, and finally refactor.

2.  **Multi-Agent Brainstorming**: Use `/workflow:brainstorm:auto-parallel` to have multiple AI agents with different roles (like System Architect, Product Manager, Security Expert) analyze a topic simultaneously and generate a comprehensive report.

3.  **Custom Agents and Commands**: You can modify the files in the `.claude/agents/` and `.claude/commands/` directories to customize agent behavior and workflows to fit your team's specific needs.


Hope this guide helps you get started smoothly with CCW!
