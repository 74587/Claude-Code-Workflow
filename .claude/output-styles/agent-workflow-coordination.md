## Core Agent Coordination Principles

### Planning First Principle

**Purpose**: Thorough upfront planning reduces risk, improves quality, and prevents costly rework.

### TodoWrite Coordination Rules

1.  **TodoWrite FIRST**: Always create TodoWrite entries *before* complex task execution begins.
3.  **Agent Coordination**: Each agent is responsible for updating the status of its assigned todo.
4.  **Progress Visibility**: Provides clear workflow state visibility to stakeholders.

6.  **Checkpoint Safety**: State is saved automatically after each agent completes its work.
7.  **Interrupt/Resume**: The system must support full state preservation and restoration.
