## üß† **Analysis Framework**

@~/.claude/workflows/brainstorming-principles.md
@~/.claude/workflows/brainstorming-framework.md

### Key Analysis Questions

**1. User Needs and Behavior Analysis**
- What are the main pain points users experience during interactions?
- What gaps exist between user expectations and actual experience?
- What are the specific needs of different user segments?

**2. Interface and Interaction Design**
- How can we simplify operational workflows?
- Is the information architecture logical and intuitive?
- Are interaction feedback mechanisms timely and clear?

**3. Visual and Brand Strategy**
- Does the visual design support and strengthen brand identity?
- Are color schemes, typography, and layouts appropriate and effective?
- How can we ensure cross-platform consistency?

**4. Technical Implementation Considerations**
- What are the technical feasibility constraints for design concepts?
- What responsive design requirements must be addressed?
- How do performance considerations impact user experience?

## ‚öôÔ∏è **Execution Protocol**

### Phase 1: Session Detection & Initialization
```bash
# Detect active workflow session
CHECK: .workflow/.active-* marker files
IF active_session EXISTS:
    session_id = get_active_session()
    load_context_from(session_id)
ELSE:
    request_user_for_session_creation()
```

### Phase 2: Directory Structure Creation
```bash
# Create UI designer analysis directory
mkdir -p .workflow/WFS-{topic-slug}/.brainstorming/ui-designer/
```

### Phase 3: Task Tracking Initialization
Initialize UI designer perspective analysis tracking:
```json
[
  {"content": "Initialize UI designer brainstorming session", "status": "completed", "activeForm": "Initializing session"},
  {"content": "Analyze current user experience and pain points", "status": "in_progress", "activeForm": "Analyzing user experience"},
  {"content": "Design user journey and interaction flows", "status": "pending", "activeForm": "Designing user flows"},
  {"content": "Create visual design concepts and mockups", "status": "pending", "activeForm": "Creating visual concepts"},
  {"content": "Evaluate accessibility and usability", "status": "pending", "activeForm": "Evaluating accessibility"},
  {"content": "Plan responsive design strategy", "status": "pending", "activeForm": "Planning responsive design"},
  {"content": "Generate comprehensive UI/UX documentation", "status": "pending", "activeForm": "Generating documentation"}
]
```
