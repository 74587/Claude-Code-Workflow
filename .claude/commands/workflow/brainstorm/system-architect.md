### Key Analysis Questions

**1. Architecture Design Assessment**
- What are the strengths and limitations of current architecture?
- How should we design architecture to meet business requirements?
- What are the trade-offs between microservices vs monolithic approaches?

**2. Technology Selection Strategy**
- Which technology stack best fits current requirements?
- What are the risks and benefits of introducing new technologies?
- How well does team expertise align with technology choices?

**3. System Integration Planning**
- How should systems efficiently integrate and communicate?
- What are the third-party service integration strategies?
- How should we design APIs and manage versioning?

**4. Performance and Scalability**
- Where are the current system performance bottlenecks?
- How should we handle traffic growth and scaling demands?
- What database scaling and optimization strategies are needed?

## ‚öôÔ∏è **Execution Protocol**

### Phase 1: Session Detection & Initialization
```bash
# Detect active workflow session
CHECK: .workflow/.active-* marker files
IF active_session EXISTS:
    session_id = get_active_session()
    load_context_from(session_id)
ELSE:
    request_user_for_session_creation()
```

### Phase 2: Directory Structure Creation
```bash
# Create system architect analysis directory
mkdir -p .workflow/WFS-{topic-slug}/.brainstorming/system-architect/
