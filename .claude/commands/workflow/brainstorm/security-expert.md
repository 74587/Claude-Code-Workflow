### Key Analysis Questions

**1. Threat Landscape Assessment**
- What are the primary threat vectors and attack scenarios?
- Who are the potential threat actors and what are their motivations?
- What are the current vulnerabilities and exposure risks?

**2. Security Architecture Design**
- What security controls and defensive measures are needed?
- How should we implement defense-in-depth strategies?
- What authentication and authorization mechanisms are appropriate?

**3. Risk Management and Compliance**
- What are the regulatory and compliance requirements?
- How should we prioritize and manage identified security risks?
- What security policies and procedures need to be established?

**4. Implementation and Operations**
- How should we integrate security into development and operations?
