# Brainstorm Clarification Command

## üìñ Overview

### Purpose
**Multi-phase interactive clarification workflow** that collects user decisions through intelligent questioning, generating a **confirmed guidance specification** (declarative statements) rather than open-ended questions (interrogative sentences).

### Core Philosophy Change
- ‚ùå **OLD**: Generate guidance-specification.md with open questions ("What are...?", "How should...?")
- ‚úÖ **NEW**: Multi-step clarification ‚Üí Generate guidance-specification.md with confirmed decisions

### User Intent Preservation
Topic description is stored in session metadata and serves as authoritative reference throughout workflow lifecycle.

---

## üéØ Usage

### Basic Command
```bash
/workflow:brainstorm:artifacts "<topic>"
```

---

## üìã Phase 1: Intent Classification

### Purpose
Understand project type and focus areas to customize subsequent questions.

### Implementation
Use **AskUserQuestion** tool to intelligently generate 2-3 classification questions based on user's topic description.

### Question Types (Intelligently Generated)
1. **Project Type**: New feature / Optimization / Refactoring
2. **Value Focus**: UX-driven / Technical capability / Business value
3. **System Scale**: Small (MVP) / Medium / Large (Enterprise)

### Output
- **intent_context**: Classification results
- Stored in session metadata for Phase 2-4 customization

### Example Flow
```javascript
AskUserQuestion({
  questions: [{
    question: "What is the project type?",
    header: "Project Type",
    multiSelect: false,
    options: [
      {label: "New Feature Development", description: "Build new features or products from scratch"},
      {label: "System Optimization", description: "Improve performance, experience, or architecture"},
      {label: "Architecture Migration", description: "Technology stack upgrade or system migration"}
    ]
  }]
  // ... Generate 2-3 classification questions similarly
})
```

---

## üë• Phase 2: Role Selection

  ‚Üí system-architect, data-architect, subject-matter-expert
- **API/Backend keywords** (api, endpoint, rest, graphql, service)
  ‚Üí api-designer, system-architect, data-architect
- **UX keywords** (user, ui, ux, design, experience)
  ‚Üí ui-designer, ux-expert, product-manager
- **Business keywords** (business, process, workflow, cost)
  ‚Üí product-manager, product-owner
- **Agile keywords** (sprint, scrum, team, delivery)
  ‚Üí scrum-master, product-owner

**3. Present to User**
Use AskUserQuestion with multiSelect for role selection.

### Available Roles

**Technical**: `system-architect`, `data-architect`, `subject-matter-expert`, `api-designer`
**Product & Design**: `ui-designer`, `ux-expert`, `product-manager`, `product-owner`

## üéì Phase 3: Role-Specific Professional Questions

### Purpose
Collect decisions for each role's professional domain.

### Implementation
For each selected role, **intelligently generate 3-5 core questions** based on:
- Role's professional expertise area
- User's topic description
- Phase 1 intent context

### Question Generation Rules
1. **Exactly 3 options** per question (MECE principle)
2. **Concrete and actionable** options
3. **Avoid vague options** like "depends on situation"
4. **Use AskUserQuestion** with multiSelect: false

### Role Question Focus Areas

**system-architect**:
- Architecture style (microservices/monolith/hybrid)
- Data consistency (strong/eventual/hybrid)
- Performance priority (latency/throughput/resource)
- Deployment model (cloud-native/VM/serverless)

**ui-designer**:
- Visual style (minimalist/rich/professional)
- Component complexity (simple/moderate/complex)
- Design system maturity (full/basic/lightweight)
- Responsive strategy (mobile-first/desktop-first/adaptive)

**ux-expert**:
- User persona (novice/intermediate/expert)
- Interaction complexity (simple/rich/professional)
- Accessibility level (WCAG AA/AAA/basic)
- Testing strategy (comprehensive/targeted/minimal)

**product-manager**:
- MVP scope (minimal core/core+hooks/full feature set)
- Timeline expectation (fast iteration/standard/robust)
- Priority strategy (user value/technical debt/innovation)
- Success metrics (usage/satisfaction/revenue)

**data-architect**:
- Storage technology (relational/NoSQL/polyglot)
- Data model complexity (simple/moderate/complex domain)

- Compliance requirements (GDPR/HIPAA/none)

**Other roles** (api-designer, product-owner, scrum-master, subject-matter-expert, test-strategist):
Similar 3-5 questions tailored to their domains.

### Example: System Architect Questions

For topic "Build real-time collaboration platform":

```javascript
AskUserQuestion({
  questions: [
    {
      question: "System architecture style preference?",
      header: "Architecture Style",
      multiSelect: false,
      options: [
        {label: "Microservices", description: "Independent service deployment, suitable for large teams"},
        {label: "Modular Monolith", description: "Single deployment unit, suitable for small to medium teams"},
        {label: "Hybrid Architecture", description: "Core monolith + partial microservices"}
      ]
    }
    // ... Generate 3-5 questions similarly
  ]
})
```

**Other roles**: Generate similarly based on professional domains (see "Role Question Focus Areas")

### Output
- **role_decisions**: Map of {role: [answers]} for all selected roles
- Stored in session metadata

---

## üîó Phase 4: Cross-Role Clarification Questions

### Purpose
Ensure consistency across roles and identify potential conflicts.

### Implementation
For each selected role, **intelligently generate 1-2 cross-role questions** from perspectives of 2-3 related roles.

### Cross-Role Relationship Matrix

| Current Role | Question from Role Perspectives | Question Topics |
|---------|------------------|---------|
| system-architect | ui-designer, product-manager, data-architect | Frontend stack, MVP scope, storage choice |
| ui-designer | ux-expert, system-architect, product-owner | Design system, technical constraints, feature priority |
| product-manager | system-architect, ux-expert, scrum-master | Technical feasibility, user pain points, delivery rhythm |
| ux-expert | ui-designer, product-manager, subject-matter-expert | Visual style, user goals, industry norms |
| data-architect | system-architect, subject-matter-expert, api-designer | Integration patterns, compliance requirements, API design |

### Example: Cross-Role Question

System-architect asking from ui-designer perspective:

```javascript
AskUserQuestion({
  questions: [{
    question: "Frontend technology stack choice? (Impacts frontend-backend separation strategy)",
    header: "Frontend Stack",
    multiSelect: false,
    options: [
      {label: "Modern Framework (React/Vue)", description: "Requires dedicated frontend team"},
      {label: "Server-Side Rendering (Next.js)", description: "SEO-friendly"},
      {label: "Lightweight (jQuery)", description: "Backend-driven"}
    ]
  }]
  // ... 1-2 cross-role questions per role
})
```

### Output
- **cross_role_decisions**: Map of {role: {from_role: [answers]}}
- Stored in session metadata

---

## üìÑ Phase 5: Generate Guidance Specification

### Purpose
Based on all user choices, generate a confirmed guidance document with **declarative statements**, not questions.

### Implementation
1. **Consolidate all decisions**:
   - intent_context (Phase 1)
   - selected_roles (Phase 2)
   - role_decisions (Phase 3)
   - cross_role_decisions (Phase 4)

2. **Generate guidance-specification.md** with confirmed decisions

### Output Document Structure

See **"Output Specification"** section below for complete template.

### Output Location
```
.workflow/WFS-[topic]/.brainstorming/guidance-specification.md
```

**Detailed file structure**: See "Reference Information > File Structure"

## üîß Implementation Details

### Session Management ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL

**‚ö° First Step**: Check `.workflow/.active-*` markers

**Logic**:
- Multiple active sessions ‚Üí Prompt user to select
- Single active session ‚Üí Use that session
- No active session ‚Üí Create new `WFS-[topic-slug]`

**Session Data Storage**:
- Decision data: `workflow-session.json`
- Output file: `.brainstorming/guidance-specification.md`

### Implementation Workflow

**Execution Flow**:
1. **Session Management**: Detect or create session
2. **Phase 1**: Intent classification (2-3 questions)
3. **Phase 2**: Role selection (recommendations + multiSelect)
4. **Phase 3**: Role professional questions (3-5 questions per role)
5. **Phase 4**: Cross-role clarification (1-2 questions per role)
6. **Phase 5**: Generate guidance-specification.md
7. **Update Metadata**: Save all decisions to session

**TodoWrite tracking**: Update progress at each Phase

**Decision storage**: All user choices saved to `workflow-session.json`

---

## ü§ñ Intelligent Question Generation

### Core Principle
All questions are **intelligently generated by Claude** based on:
- Role professional domain
- User's topic description
- Previous decision context
- Phase 1 intent classification

**No Template Library Required**: Questions are dynamically created to fit specific task context.

### Question Generation Guidelines

**For Phase 3 (Role Questions)**:
```
INPUT: role + topic + intent_context
OUTPUT: 3-5 questions, each with 3 MECE options

Example:
- Role: system-architect
- Topic: "Build real-time collaboration platform"
- Intent: {type: "new_feature", scale: "medium", focus: "technical"}

Generated Questions:
1. Architecture style? [Microservices/Modular Monolith/Hybrid]
2. Real-time communication tech? [WebSocket/SSE/Polling]
3. Data consistency? [Strong/Eventual/Hybrid]
4. Deployment model? [Cloud-native/Traditional VM/Serverless]
```

**For Phase 4 (Cross-Role Questions)**:
```
INPUT: current_role + related_role + role_decisions + topic
OUTPUT: 1-2 questions from related_role perspective

Example:
- Current: system-architect
- Related: ui-designer
- Topic: "Build real-time collaboration platform"
- Context: ui-designer chose "Modern Framework (React)"

Generated Question:
"Frontend technology stack choice? (Impacts frontend-backend separation strategy)"
[Modern Framework/Server-Side Rendering/Lightweight]
```

## ‚úÖ Validation & Quality Assurance

### Output Validation

**Guidance Specification Must Contain**:
- ‚úÖ **All declarative statements**: No question marks in decision sections
- ‚úÖ **Clear decisions**: Every decision point has explicit choice
- ‚úÖ **Decision traceability**: Can trace back to user answers
- ‚úÖ **Cross-role consistency**: Conflicts resolved or noted
- ‚úÖ **Actionability**: Next steps are clear

### Validation Checklist

The generated guidance-specification.md must pass these checks:

‚úÖ **No interrogative sentences**: Decision sections should not end with question marks
‚úÖ **Clear decisions**: Every decision point has explicit choice (not "TBD"/"Pending")
‚úÖ **Traceable**: Every decision can be traced back to user answers
‚úÖ **Cross-role consistency**: Cross-role decision count ‚â• number of selected roles
‚úÖ **Actionable**: "Next steps" are clear and specific

**Automatic validation**: Execute checks after generation, prompt if issues found

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Error Handling

| Error Type | Handling Strategy |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Session creation failed | Error details + retry option + check permissions |
| AskUserQuestion timeout | Save progress + allow resumption + provide instructions |
| Incomplete clarification | Mark open items + suggest follow-up clarification |
| Conflicting decisions | Highlight conflicts + show disagreeing roles + suggest resolution |

---

## üîó Integration with Downstream Workflow

### Core Principles & Governance Rules

**GOVERNANCE_RULES** for guidance-specification.md output:

‚úÖ **Declarative Statements Only**
- All decisions MUST use CONFIRMED/SELECTED format
- NO interrogative sentences (no "?" in decision sections)
- NO open questions or TBD items in confirmed decisions

‚úÖ **Decision Traceability**
- Every decision MUST trace back to specific user answer
- Cross-reference to Phase 1-4 clarification responses
- Document rationale for each confirmed choice

‚úÖ **Cross-Role Consistency**
- Cross-role decisions count ‚â• number of selected roles
- Conflicts MUST be resolved or explicitly documented
- Dependencies between roles clearly stated

‚úÖ **Actionability Requirements**
- Next steps MUST be concrete and specific
- Role assignments clearly defined
- Success criteria measurable and verifiable

‚úÖ **Session Integrity**
- All decisions stored in `workflow-session.json`
- Topic description preserved as authoritative reference
- Session lifecycle properly managed (active markers, metadata)

**CRITICAL**: Generated guidance is the **single source of truth** for all downstream workflow phases. Any ambiguity violates governance rules and MUST be resolved before proceeding.

---

### Next Steps After Guidance Generation

**Standard Workflow**:
```bash
/workflow:concept-clarify --session WFS-{session-id}           # Optional: Further clarification
/workflow:plan --session WFS-{session-id}                      # Generate IMPL_PLAN.md and tasks
/workflow:action-plan-verify --session WFS-{session-id}        # Optional: Verify plan quality
