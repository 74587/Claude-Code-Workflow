## ‚öôÔ∏è **Execution Protocol**

### Phase 1: Session Detection & Data Collection
```bash
# Detect active brainstorming session
CHECK: .workflow/.active-* marker files
IF active_session EXISTS:
    session_id = get_active_session()
    load_context_from(session_id)
ELSE:
    ERROR: "No active brainstorming session found. Please run role-specific brainstorming commands first."
    EXIT
```

### Phase 2: Role Output Scanning
```bash
# Scan all role brainstorming outputs
SCAN_DIRECTORY: .workflow/WFS-{session}/.brainstorming/
COLLECT_OUTPUTS: [
    product-manager/analysis.md,
    system-architect/analysis.md,
    ui-designer/analysis.md,
    data-architect/analysis.md,
    security-expert/analysis.md,
    user-researcher/analysis.md,
    business-analyst/analysis.md,
    innovation-lead/analysis.md,
    feature-planner/analysis.md
]
```

### Phase 3: Task Tracking Initialization
Initialize synthesis analysis task tracking:
```json
[
  {"content": "Initialize brainstorming synthesis session", "status": "completed", "activeForm": "Initializing synthesis"},
  {"content": "Collect and analyze all role perspectives", "status": "in_progress", "activeForm": "Collecting role analyses"},
  {"content": "Identify cross-role insights and patterns", "status": "pending", "activeForm": "Identifying insights"},
  {"content": "Generate consensus and disagreement analysis", "status": "pending", "activeForm": "Analyzing consensus"},
  {"content": "Create prioritized recommendations matrix", "status": "pending", "activeForm": "Creating recommendations"},
  {"content": "Generate comprehensive synthesis report", "status": "pending", "activeForm": "Generating synthesis report"},
  {"content": "Create action plan with implementation priorities", "status": "pending", "activeForm": "Creating action plan"}
]
```

### Phase 4: Cross-Role Analysis Execution

#### 4.1 Data Collection and Preprocessing
```pseudo
FOR each role_directory in brainstorming_roles:
    IF role_directory exists:
        role_analysis = Read(role_directory + "/analysis.md")
        role_recommendations = Read(role_directory + "/recommendations.md") IF EXISTS
        role_insights[role] = extract_key_insights(role_analysis)
        role_recommendations[role] = extract_recommendations(role_analysis)
        role_concerns[role] = extract_concerns_risks(role_analysis)
    END IF
END FOR
```

#### 4.2 Cross-Role Insight Analysis
```pseudo
# Consensus identification
consensus_areas = identify_common_themes(role_insights)
agreement_matrix = create_agreement_matrix(role_recommendations)

# Disagreement analysis
disagreement_areas = identify_conflicting_views(role_insights)
tension_points = analyze_role_conflicts(role_recommendations)

# Innovation opportunity extraction
innovation_opportunities = extract_breakthrough_ideas(role_insights)
synergy_opportunities = identify_cross_role_synergies(role_insights)
```

#### 4.3 Priority and Decision Matrix Generation
```pseudo
# Create comprehensive evaluation matrix
FOR each recommendation:
    impact_score = calculate_business_impact(recommendation, role_insights)
    feasibility_score = calculate_technical_feasibility(recommendation, role_insights)
    effort_score = calculate_implementation_effort(recommendation, role_insights)
    risk_score = calculate_associated_risks(recommendation, role_insights)
    
    priority_score = weighted_score(impact_score, feasibility_score, effort_score, risk_score)
END FOR

SORT recommendations BY priority_score DESC
```
