## üß© **Synthesis Document Generator**

### Core Function
**Specialized command for generating synthesis-report.md** that integrates topic-framework.md and all role analysis.md files using @ reference system. Creates comprehensive strategic analysis with cross-role insights.

### Primary Capabilities
- **Framework Integration**: Reference topic-framework.md discussion points across all roles
- **Role Analysis Integration**: Consolidate all role/analysis.md files using @ references
- **Cross-Framework Comparison**: Compare how each role addressed framework discussion points
- **@ Reference System**: Create structured references to source documents
- **Update Detection**: Smart updates when new role analyses are added

### Document Integration Model
**Three-Document Reference System**:
1. **topic-framework.md** ‚Üí Structured discussion framework (input)
2. **[role]/analysis.md** ‚Üí Role-specific analyses addressing framework (input)
3. **synthesis-report.md** ‚Üí Integrated synthesis with @ references (output)

## ‚öôÔ∏è **Execution Protocol**

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Direct Execution Only
**DO NOT use Task tool or delegate to any agent** - This is a document synthesis task using only Read/Write/Glob tools for aggregating existing analyses.

### Phase 1: Document Discovery & Validation
```bash
# Detect active brainstorming session
CHECK: .workflow/.active-* marker files
IF active_session EXISTS:
    session_id = get_active_session()
    brainstorm_dir = .workflow/WFS-{session}/.brainstorming/
ELSE:
    ERROR: "No active brainstorming session found"
    EXIT

# Validate required documents
CHECK: brainstorm_dir/topic-framework.md
IF NOT EXISTS:
    ERROR: "topic-framework.md not found. Run /workflow:brainstorm:artifacts first"
    EXIT
```

### Phase 2: Role Analysis Discovery
```bash
# Discover available role analyses
SCAN_DIRECTORY: .workflow/WFS-{session}/.brainstorming/
FIND_ANALYSES: [
    */analysis.md files in role directories
]
LOAD_DOCUMENTS: {
    "topic_framework": topic-framework.md,
    "role_analyses": [discovered analysis.md files],
    "existing_synthesis": synthesis-report.md (if exists)
}
```

### Phase 3: Update Mechanism Check
```bash
# Check for existing synthesis
IF synthesis-report.md EXISTS:
    SHOW current synthesis summary to user
    ASK: "Synthesis exists. Do you want to:"
    OPTIONS:
      1. "Regenerate completely" ‚Üí Create new synthesis
      2. "Update with new analyses" ‚Üí Integrate new role analyses
      3. "Preserve existing" ‚Üí Exit without changes
ELSE:
    CREATE new synthesis
```

### Phase 4: Synthesis Generation Process
Initialize synthesis task tracking:
```json
[
  {"content": "Validate topic-framework.md and role analyses availability", "status": "in_progress", "activeForm": "Validating source documents"},
  {"content": "Load topic framework discussion points structure", "status": "pending", "activeForm": "Loading framework structure"},
  {"content": "Cross-analyze role responses to each framework point", "status": "pending", "activeForm": "Cross-analyzing framework responses"},
  {"content": "Generate synthesis-report.md with @ references", "status": "pending", "activeForm": "Generating synthesis with references"},
  {"content": "Update session metadata with synthesis completion", "status": "pending", "activeForm": "Updating session metadata"}
]
```

### Phase 4: Cross-Role Analysis Execution

#### 4.1 Data Collection and Preprocessing
```pseudo
FOR each role_directory in brainstorming_roles:
    IF role_directory exists:
        role_analysis = Read(role_directory + "/analysis.md")
        role_recommendations = Read(role_directory + "/recommendations.md") IF EXISTS
        role_insights[role] = extract_key_insights(role_analysis)
        role_recommendations[role] = extract_recommendations(role_analysis)
        role_concerns[role] = extract_concerns_risks(role_analysis)
    END IF
END FOR
```

#### 4.2 Cross-Role Insight Analysis
```pseudo
# Consensus identification
consensus_areas = identify_common_themes(role_insights)
agreement_matrix = create_agreement_matrix(role_recommendations)

# Disagreement analysis
disagreement_areas = identify_conflicting_views(role_insights)
tension_points = analyze_role_conflicts(role_recommendations)

# Innovation opportunity extraction
innovation_opportunities = extract_breakthrough_ideas(role_insights)
synergy_opportunities = identify_cross_role_synergies(role_insights)
```

#### 4.3 Priority and Decision Matrix Generation
```pseudo
# Create comprehensive evaluation matrix
FOR each recommendation:
    impact_score = calculate_business_impact(recommendation, role_insights)
    feasibility_score = calculate_technical_feasibility(recommendation, role_insights)
    effort_score = calculate_implementation_effort(recommendation, role_insights)
    risk_score = calculate_associated_risks(recommendation, role_insights)
    
    priority_score = weighted_score(impact_score, feasibility_score, effort_score, risk_score)
END FOR

SORT recommendations BY priority_score DESC
```
