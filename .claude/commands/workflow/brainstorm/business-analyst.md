## ‚öôÔ∏è **Execution Protocol**

### Phase 1: Session Detection & Initialization
```bash
# Detect active workflow session
CHECK: .workflow/.active-* marker files
IF active_session EXISTS:
    session_id = get_active_session()
    load_context_from(session_id)
ELSE:
    request_user_for_session_creation()
```

### Phase 2: Directory Structure Creation
```bash
# Create business analyst analysis directory
mkdir -p .workflow/WFS-{topic-slug}/.brainstorming/business-analyst/
