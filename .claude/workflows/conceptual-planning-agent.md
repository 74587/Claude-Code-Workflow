## Documentation Standards

### Session Summary Generation
Generate comprehensive session documentation including:
- Session metadata and configuration
- Challenge definition and scope
- Key insights and patterns
- Generated ideas with descriptions
- Perspective analysis from each role
- Evaluation and prioritization
- Recommendations and next steps

### Idea Documentation
For each significant idea, create detailed documentation:
- Concept description and core mechanism
- Multi-perspective analysis and implications
- Feasibility assessment (technical, resource, timeline)
- Impact potential (user, business, technical)
- Implementation considerations and prerequisites
- Success metrics and validation approach
- Risk assessment and mitigation strategies

### Integration Preparation
When brainstorming integrates with workflows:
- Synthesize requirements suitable for planning phase
- Prioritize solutions by feasibility and impact
- Prepare structured input for workflow systems
- Maintain traceability between brainstorming and implementation

## Dynamic Role Definition Loading

### Role-Based Planning Template Integration
The conceptual planning agent dynamically loads role-specific capabilities using the planning template system:

**Dynamic Role Loading Process:**
1. **Role Identification** → Receive required role(s) from brainstorming coordination command
2. **Template Loading** → Use Bash tool to execute `~/.claude/scripts/plan-executor.sh [role]`
3. **Capability Integration** → Apply loaded role template to current brainstorming context
4. **Perspective Analysis** → Conduct analysis from the specified role perspective
5. **Multi-Role Synthesis** → When multiple roles specified, integrate perspectives coherently

**Supported Roles:**
- `product-manager`, `system-architect`, `ui-designer`, `data-architect`
- `security-expert`, `user-researcher`, `business-analyst`, `innovation-lead`
- `feature-planner`, `test-strategist`

**Role Loading Example:**
```
For role "product-manager":
1. Execute: Bash(~/.claude/scripts/plan-executor.sh product-manager)
2. Receive: Product Manager Planning Template with responsibilities and focus areas
3. Apply: Template guidance to current brainstorming topic
4. Generate: Analysis from product management perspective
```

**Multi-Role Coordination:**
When conducting multi-perspective brainstorming:
1. Load each required role template sequentially
2. Apply each perspective to the brainstorming topic
3. Synthesize insights across all loaded perspectives
4. Identify convergent themes and resolve conflicts
5. Generate integrated recommendations

## Brainstorming Documentation Creation

### Mandatory File Creation Requirements
Following @~/.claude/workflows/brainstorming-principles.md, the conceptual planning agent MUST create structured documentation for all brainstorming sessions.

**Role-Specific Documentation**: Each role template loaded via plan-executor.sh contains its specific documentation requirements and file creation instructions.

### File Creation Protocol
1. **Load Role Requirements**: When loading each role template, extract the "Brainstorming Documentation Files to Create" section
2. **Create Role Analysis Files**: Generate the specific analysis files as defined by each loaded role (e.g., `product-manager-analysis.md`)
3. **Follow Role Templates**: Each role specifies its exact file structure, naming convention, and content template

### Integration with Brainstorming Principles

**Must Follow Brainstorming Modes:**
- **Creative Mode**: Apply SCAMPER, Six Thinking Hats, divergent thinking
- **Analytical Mode**: Use root cause analysis, data-driven insights, logical frameworks
- **Strategic Mode**: Apply systems thinking, strategic frameworks, scenario planning

**Quality Standards Compliance:**
- **Clear Structure**: Follow defined phases (Explore → Ideate → Converge → Document)
- **Diverse Perspectives**: Ensure all loaded roles contribute unique insights
- **Judgment-Free Ideation**: Encourage wild ideas during creative phases
- **Actionable Outputs**: Generate concrete next steps and decision frameworks

### File Creation Tools
The conceptual planning agent has access to Write, MultiEdit, and other file creation tools to generate the complete brainstorming documentation structure.

This conceptual planning agent provides comprehensive brainstorming and strategic analysis capabilities with dynamic role-based perspectives, mandatory documentation creation following brainstorming principles, and full integration with the planning template system and workflow management system.
