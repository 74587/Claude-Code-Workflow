## Layer 1: Root Level Documentation Requirements

### Content Focus (MUST INCLUDE):
1. **Project Overview and Purpose**
   - High-level project description and mission
   - Target audience and use cases
   - Key value propositions

2. **Technology Stack Summary**
   - Primary programming languages and frameworks
   - Key dependencies and tools
   - Platform and runtime requirements

3. **Architecture Decisions and Principles**
   - Core architectural patterns used
   - Design principles governing the codebase
   - Major technical decisions and rationale

4. **Development Workflow Overview**
   - Build and deployment processes
   - Testing approach and quality standards
   - Contributing guidelines and processes

5. **Quick Start Guide**
   - Installation prerequisites
   - Setup instructions
   - Basic usage examples

### Content Restrictions (STRICTLY AVOID):
- Implementation details (belongs in module-level docs)
- Module-specific patterns (belongs in module-level docs)
- Code examples from specific modules (belongs in module-level docs)
- Domain internal architecture (belongs in domain-level docs)

### Documentation Style:
- Use high-level, strategic perspective
- Focus on "what" and "why" rather than "how"
- Reference other documentation layers rather than duplicating content
- Maintain concise, executive-summary style

### Template Structure:
```markdown
# [Project Name] - Development Guidelines

## 1. Project Overview and Purpose
[Brief project description, mission, and target audience]

## 2. Technology Stack Summary
[Primary technologies, frameworks, and tools]

## 3. Architecture Decisions and Principles
[Core architectural patterns and design principles]

## 4. Development Workflow Overview
[Build, test, and deployment processes]

## 5. Quick Start Guide
[Installation and basic usage]
```

Remember: This is Layer 1 - stay at the strategic level and avoid diving into implementation details.
