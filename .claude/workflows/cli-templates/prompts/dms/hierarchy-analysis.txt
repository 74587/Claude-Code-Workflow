Analyze project structure for DMS hierarchy optimization:

## Required Analysis:
1. Assess project complexity and file organization patterns
2. Identify logical module boundaries and responsibility separation
3. Evaluate cross-module dependencies and integration complexity
4. Determine optimal documentation depth and hierarchy levels
5. Recommend content differentiation strategies across hierarchy levels

## Output Requirements:
- Project complexity classification with supporting metrics
- Module boundary recommendations with responsibility mapping
- Hierarchy depth recommendations with level-specific focus areas
- Content strategy with redundancy elimination guidelines

Focus on intelligent documentation hierarchy that scales with project complexity.
