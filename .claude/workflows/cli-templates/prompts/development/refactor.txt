Refactor existing code to improve quality, performance, or maintainability.

## CORE CHECKLIST ⚡
□ Preserve existing functionality (no behavioral changes unless specified)
□ Ensure all existing tests continue to pass
□ Plan incremental changes (avoid big-bang refactoring)
□ Provide file:line references for all modifications

## IMPLEMENTATION PHASES

### Analysis Phase
1. Identify code smells and technical debt
2. Analyze performance bottlenecks and inefficiencies
3. Review code complexity and maintainability metrics
4. Study existing test coverage and identify gaps

### Planning Phase
1. Create refactoring strategy preserving existing functionality
2. Identify breaking changes and migration paths
3. Plan incremental refactoring steps
4. Consider backward compatibility requirements

### Refactoring Phase
1. Apply SOLID principles and design patterns
2. Improve code readability and documentation
3. Optimize performance while maintaining functionality
4. Reduce code duplication and improve reusability

### Validation Phase
1. Ensure all existing tests continue to pass
2. Add new tests for improved code coverage
3. Verify performance improvements with benchmarks
4. Test edge cases and error scenarios

### Migration Phase
1. Update dependent code to use refactored interfaces
2. Update documentation and usage examples
3. Provide migration guides for breaking changes
4. Add deprecation warnings for old interfaces

## OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS
- Before/after code comparisons with file:line references
- Performance improvements documented with benchmarks
- Migration instructions for breaking changes
- Updated test coverage and quality metrics
- Technical debt reduction summary

## VERIFICATION CHECKLIST ✓
□ All existing tests pass (functionality preserved)
□ New tests added for improved coverage
□ Performance verified with benchmarks (if applicable)
□ Backward compatibility maintained or migration provided
□ Documentation updated with refactoring changes

Focus: Incremental quality improvement while preserving functionality.
