Analyze security implementation and potential vulnerabilities.

## CORE CHECKLIST ⚡
□ Identify all data entry points and external system interfaces
□ Provide file:line references for all potential vulnerabilities
□ Classify risks by severity and type (e.g., OWASP Top 10)
□ Apply RULES template requirements exactly as specified

## REQUIRED ANALYSIS
1. Identify authentication and authorization mechanisms
2. Assess input validation and sanitization practices
3. Review data encryption and secure storage methods
4. Evaluate API security and access control patterns
5. Document security risks and compliance considerations

## OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS
- Security vulnerability findings with file:line references
- Authentication/authorization pattern documentation
- Input validation examples and identified gaps
- Encryption usage patterns and recommendations
- Prioritized remediation plan based on risk level

## VERIFICATION CHECKLIST ✓
□ All CONTEXT files analyzed for security vulnerabilities
□ Every finding is backed by a code reference (file:line)
□ Both authentication and data handling are covered
□ Recommendations include clear, actionable remediation steps

Focus: Identifying security gaps and providing actionable remediation steps.
