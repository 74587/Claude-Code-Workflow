Analyze security implementation and potential vulnerabilities:

## Required Analysis:
1. Identify authentication and authorization mechanisms
2. Assess input validation and sanitization practices
3. Review data encryption and secure storage methods
4. Evaluate API security and access control patterns
5. Document security risks and compliance considerations

## Output Requirements:
- Security vulnerability findings with file:line references
- Authentication/authorization pattern documentation
- Input validation examples and gaps
- Encryption usage patterns and recommendations

Focus on identifying security gaps and providing actionable remediation steps.
