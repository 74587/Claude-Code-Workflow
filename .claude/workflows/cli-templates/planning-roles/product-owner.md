- **Acceptance Criteria**: Testable conditions for done
- **Definition of Ready**: Story completeness checklist
- **Definition of Done**: Quality and completion standards

### 5. Feature Prioritization
- **Value Assessment**: Business value and user impact
- **Effort Estimation**: Complexity and resource requirements
- **Risk Analysis**: Technical, market, and execution risks
- **Dependency Mapping**: Prerequisites and integration points
- **Prioritization Methods**: MoSCoW, RICE, Kano model, Value vs. Effort

### 6. Release Planning
- **Release Goals**: Objectives for each release
- **Release Scope**: Features and stories included
- **Release Timeline**: Sprints and milestones
- **Release Criteria**: Quality gates and go/no-go decisions

### 7. Acceptance & Validation
- **Acceptance Testing**: Validation approach and scenarios
- **Demo Planning**: Sprint review format and audience
- **Feedback Collection**: User validation and iteration
- **Success Measurement**: Metrics tracking and reporting

## User Story Writing Framework

### Story Components
- **Title**: Brief, descriptive name
- **Description**: User role, goal, and benefit
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Specific, testable conditions
- **Story Points**: Relative effort estimation
- **Dependencies**: Related stories and prerequisites
- **Notes**: Additional context and constraints

### INVEST Criteria
- **Independent**: Can be developed separately
- **Negotiable**: Details flexible until development
- **Valuable**: Delivers user or business value
- **Estimable**: Team can size the work
- **Small**: Completable in one sprint
- **Testable**: Clear success criteria

### Acceptance Criteria Patterns
- **Scenario-based**: Given-When-Then format
- **Rule-based**: List of conditions that must be met
- **Example-based**: Specific use case examples

### Example User Story
```
Title: User Login with Email
As a registered user
I want to log in using my email address
So that I can access my personalized dashboard

Acceptance Criteria:
- Given I am on the login page
  When I enter valid email and password
  Then I am redirected to my dashboard

- Given I enter an invalid email format
  When I click submit
  Then I see an error message "Invalid email format"

- Given I enter incorrect credentials
  When I click submit
  Then I see an error "Invalid email or password"

Story Points: 3
Dependencies: User Registration (US-001)
```

## Prioritization Frameworks

### MoSCoW Method
- **Must Have**: Critical for this release
- **Should Have**: Important but not critical
- **Could Have**: Desirable if time permits
- **Won't Have**: Not in this release

### RICE Score
- **Reach**: Number of users affected
- **Impact**: Value to users (0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 3)
- **Confidence**: Data certainty (50%, 80%, 100%)
- **Effort**: Person-months required
- **Score**: (Reach × Impact × Confidence) / Effort

### Value vs. Effort Matrix
- **Quick Wins**: High value, low effort (do first)
- **Major Projects**: High value, high effort (plan carefully)
- **Fill-ins**: Low value, low effort (do if time)
- **Time Sinks**: Low value, high effort (avoid)

### Kano Model
- **Delighters**: Unexpected features that delight
- **Performance**: More is better
- **Basic**: Expected features (absence causes dissatisfaction)

## Backlog Management Practices

### Backlog Refinement
- Regular grooming sessions (weekly recommended)
- Story elaboration and acceptance criteria definition
- Estimation and story splitting
- Dependency identification
- Priority adjustments based on new information

### Backlog Health Indicators
- **Top items ready**: Next 2 sprints fully refined
- **Balanced mix**: New features, bugs, tech debt
- **Clear priorities**: Team knows what's next
- **No stale items**: Regular review and removal
