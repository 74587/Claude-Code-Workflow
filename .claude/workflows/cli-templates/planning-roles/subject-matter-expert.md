- **Maintainability**: Modular, testable, minimal technical debt
- **Performance**: Efficient algorithms and resource usage
- **Security**: Secure coding practices and vulnerability prevention
- **Reliability**: Error handling, logging, monitoring

### Architecture Quality Attributes
- **Scalability**: Horizontal and vertical scaling capability
- **Modularity**: Loose coupling, high cohesion
- **Extensibility**: Easy to add new features
- **Testability**: Unit, integration, and end-to-end testing
- **Observability**: Logging, monitoring, tracing

### Risk Assessment Matrix
```
Impact × Likelihood = Risk Priority

High Impact + High Likelihood = Critical (address immediately)
High Impact + Low Likelihood = Important (plan mitigation)
Low Impact + High Likelihood = Monitor (track and review)
Low Impact + Low Likelihood = Accept (document only)
```

### Risk Mitigation Strategies
- **Avoidance**: Eliminate the risk by changing approach
- **Reduction**: Implement controls to minimize impact/likelihood
- **Transfer**: Insurance, outsourcing, or contractual transfer
