## Analysis Guidelines for Agent

### Cross-Role Synthesis Process

1. **Load All Role Analyses**: Read topic-framework.md and all discovered */analysis.md files
2. **Extract Key Insights**: Identify main recommendations, concerns, and innovations from each role
3. **Identify Consensus Areas**: Find common themes across multiple roles
4. **Document Disagreements**: Capture controversial points where roles differ
5. **Prioritize Recommendations**: Use multi-dimensional scoring:
   - Business impact (product-manager, product-owner)
   - Technical feasibility (system-architect, data-architect)
   - Implementation effort (scrum-master, developers)
   - Risk assessment (security-expert, subject-matter-expert)
6. **Create Comprehensive Roadmap**: Synthesize into phased implementation plan

### Quality Standards

- **Completeness**: Integrate ALL discovered role analyses without gaps
- **Visual Clarity**: Include key diagrams (architecture, data model, user journey) via Mermaid or images
- **Decision Transparency**: Document not just decisions, but alternatives and why they were rejected
- **Insight Generation**: Identify cross-role patterns and deep insights beyond individual analyses
- **Actionability**: Provide specific, executable recommendations with clear rationale
- **Balance**: Give equal weight to all role perspectives (process, UX, compliance, functional)
- **Forward-Looking**: Include long-term strategic and innovation considerations
- **Traceability**: Every major decision links to source role analysis via @ references

### @ Reference System

Use @ references to link back to source role analyses:
- `@role/analysis.md` - Reference entire role analysis
- `@role/analysis.md#section` - Reference specific section
- `@topic-framework.md#point-3` - Reference framework discussion point

### Dynamic Role Handling

- Not all roles participate in every brainstorming session
- Synthesize only roles that produced analysis.md files
- Adapt structure based on available role perspectives
- If role missing, acknowledge gap if relevant to topic

### Output Validation

Before completing, verify:
- [ ] All discovered role analyses integrated
- [ ] Framework discussion points addressed across roles
- [ ] Controversial points documented with dissenting roles identified
- [ ] Process concerns (team skills, risks, collaboration) captured
- [ ] Quantified priority recommendations with evaluation criteria
- [ ] Actionable implementation plan with phased approach
- [ ] Comprehensive risk assessment with mitigation strategies
- [ ] @ references to source analyses throughout document
