## Design Workflow (MANDATORY)

You MUST follow this step-by-step workflow for all design tasks:

### **Phase 1: Layout Design** (ASCII Wireframe)
**Output**: Text-based wireframe in ASCII format
- Analyze user requirements and identify key UI components
- Design information architecture and content hierarchy
- Create ASCII wireframe showing component placement
- Present multiple layout options if applicable
- **⚠️ STOP and wait for user approval before proceeding**

### **Phase 2: Theme Design** (CSS Variables)
**Output**: CSS file with design system tokens
- Define color palette using OKLCH color space (avoid basic blue/indigo)
- Specify typography system using Google Fonts (JetBrains Mono, Inter, Poppins, etc.)
- Define spacing scale, shadow system, and border radius
- Choose design style: Neo-brutalism, Modern Dark Mode, or custom
- **Generate CSS file**: `.superdesign/design_iterations/theme_{n}.css`
- **⚠️ STOP and wait for user approval before proceeding**

**Theme Style References**:
- **Neo-brutalism**: Bold colors, thick borders, offset shadows, 0px radius, DM Sans/Space Mono fonts
- **Modern Dark Mode**: Neutral grays, subtle shadows, 0.625rem radius, system fonts

### **Phase 3: Animation Design** (Micro-interaction Specs)
**Output**: Animation specifications in micro-syntax format
- Define entrance/exit animations (slide, fade, scale)
- Specify hover/focus/active states
- Design loading states and transitions
- Define timing functions and durations
- Use micro-syntax format: `element: duration easing [properties] +delay`
- **⚠️ STOP and wait for user approval before proceeding**

### **Phase 4: HTML Prototype Generation** (Single-file HTML)
**Output**: Complete HTML file with embedded styles and interactions
- Generate single-page HTML prototype
- Reference theme CSS created in Phase 2
- Implement animations from Phase 3
- Use CDN libraries (Tailwind, Flowbite, Lucide icons)
- **Save to**: `.superdesign/design_iterations/{design_name}_{n}.html`
- **Must use Write tool** - DO NOT just output text

## Template Guidelines

- Start with **clear design vision** and user experience objectives
- Define **specific user personas** and their needs, goals, pain points
- Create **detailed user flows** showing how users navigate the interface
- Specify **design system components** that can be reused across the interface
- Consider **responsive design** requirements for multiple device types
- Plan for **accessibility** from the beginning, not as an afterthought
- **MUST generate visual artifacts**: ASCII wireframes + CSS themes + HTML prototypes
- **Follow 4-phase workflow** with user approval gates between phases

## Technical Requirements

### **Styling Standards**
1. **Libraries**: Use Flowbite as base library (unless user specifies otherwise)
2. **Colors**: Avoid indigo/blue unless explicitly requested; use OKLCH color space
3. **Fonts**: Google Fonts only - JetBrains Mono, Inter, Poppins, Montserrat, DM Sans, Geist, Space Grotesk
4. **Responsive**: ALL designs MUST be responsive (mobile, tablet, desktop)
5. **CSS Overrides**: Use `!important` for properties that might conflict with Tailwind/Flowbite
6. **Background Contrast**: Component backgrounds must contrast well with content (light component → dark bg, dark component → light bg)

### **Asset Requirements**
1. **Images**: Use public URLs only (Unsplash, placehold.co) - DO NOT fabricate URLs
2. **Icons**: Use Lucide icons via CDN: `<script src="https://unpkg.com/lucide@latest/dist/umd/lucide.min.js"></script>`
3. **Tailwind**: Import via script: `<script src="https://cdn.tailwindcss.com"></script>`
4. **Flowbite**: Import via script: `<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/flowbite@2.0.0/dist/flowbite.min.js"></script>`

### **File Organization**
- **Theme CSS**: `.superdesign/design_iterations/theme_{n}.css`
- **HTML Prototypes**: `.superdesign/design_iterations/{design_name}_{n}.html`
- **Iteration Naming**: If iterating `ui_1.html`, name versions as `ui_1_1.html`, `ui_1_2.html`, etc.

```
/* Entrance animations */
element: 400ms ease-out [Y+20→0, S0.9→1]
button: 150ms [S1→0.95→1] press

/* State transitions */
input: 200ms [S1→1.01, shadow+ring] focus
modal: 350ms ease-out [X-280→0, α0→1]

/* Loading states */
skeleton: 2000ms ∞ [bg: muted↔accent]
```

## Important Reminders

1. **⚠️ NEVER skip the 4-phase workflow** - Each phase requires user approval
2. **⚠️ MUST use Write tool** for generating CSS and HTML files - DO NOT just output text
3. **⚠️ Files must be saved** to `.superdesign/design_iterations/` directory
4. **⚠️ Avoid basic blue colors** unless explicitly requested by user
5. **⚠️ ALL designs must be responsive** - test across mobile, tablet, desktop viewports
