# Brainstorming Framework

## Overview
Common creative techniques, execution modes, and quality standards for all brainstorming sessions.

## Creative Techniques

### SCAMPER Method
- **Substitute**: What can be substituted or replaced?
- **Combine**: What can be combined or merged?
- **Adapt**: What can be adapted from elsewhere?
- **Modify**: What can be magnified, minimized, or modified?
- **Put to other uses**: How else can this be used?
- **Eliminate**: What can be removed or simplified?
- **Reverse**: What can be rearranged or reversed?

### Six Thinking Hats
- **White Hat**: Facts, information, data
- **Red Hat**: Emotions, feelings, intuition
- **Black Hat**: Critical judgment, caution, problems
- **Yellow Hat**: Optimism, benefits, positive thinking
- **Green Hat**: Creativity, alternatives, new ideas
- **Blue Hat**: Process control, meta-thinking

### Additional Techniques
- **Mind Mapping**: Visual idea exploration and connection
- **Brainstorming**: Free-flowing idea generation
- **Brainwriting**: Silent idea generation and building
- **Random Word**: Stimulus-based creative thinking
- **What If**: Scenario-based exploration
- **Assumption Challenging**: Question fundamental assumptions

## Execution Modes

### Creative Mode (Default)
- **Techniques**: SCAMPER, Six Thinking Hats, wild ideas
- **Focus**: Innovation and unconventional solutions
- **Approach**: 
  - Emphasize divergent thinking and wild ideas
  - Apply creative techniques extensively
  - Encourage "what if" thinking and assumption challenging
  - Focus on novel and unconventional solutions

### Analytical Mode
- **Techniques**: Root cause analysis, data-driven insights
- **Focus**: Evidence-based systematic problem-solving
- **Approach**:
  - Use structured analysis frameworks
  - Apply root cause analysis and logical thinking
  - Emphasize evidence-based reasoning
  - Focus on systematic problem-solving

### Strategic Mode
- **Techniques**: Systems thinking, scenario planning
- **Focus**: Long-term strategic positioning
- **Approach**:
  - Apply strategic thinking frameworks
  - Use systems thinking and long-term perspective
  - Consider competitive dynamics and market forces
  - Focus on strategic positioning and advantage

## Brainstorming Session Protocol

### Input Processing
```
Topic: [Challenge or opportunity description]
Mode: [creative|analytical|strategic]
Perspectives: [Selected role perspectives]
Context: [Current situation and constraints]
```

### Execution Flow
```
1. Challenge Analysis → Define scope, constraints, success criteria
2. Perspective Setup → Establish role contexts and viewpoints
3. Ideation Phase → Generate ideas using appropriate techniques
4. Convergence Phase → Evaluate, synthesize, prioritize solutions
5. Documentation → Create structured session records
```

## Documentation Standards

### Session Summary Generation
Generate comprehensive session documentation including:
- Session metadata and configuration
- Challenge definition and scope
- Key insights and patterns
- Generated ideas with descriptions
- Perspective analysis from each role
- Evaluation and prioritization
- Recommendations and next steps

### Idea Documentation
For each significant idea, create detailed documentation:
- Concept description and core mechanism
- Multi-perspective analysis and implications
- Feasibility assessment (technical, resource, timeline)
- Impact potential (user, business, technical)
- Implementation considerations and prerequisites
- Success metrics and validation approach
- Risk assessment and mitigation strategies

## Output Format Standards

### Brainstorming Session Output
```
BRAINSTORMING_SUMMARY: [Comprehensive session overview]
CHALLENGE_DEFINITION: [Clear problem space definition]
KEY_INSIGHTS: [Major discoveries and patterns]
IDEA_INVENTORY: [Structured list of all generated ideas]
TOP_CONCEPTS: [5 most promising solutions with analysis]
PERSPECTIVE_SYNTHESIS: [Integration of role-based insights]
FEASIBILITY_ASSESSMENT: [Technical and resource evaluation]
IMPACT_ANALYSIS: [Expected outcomes and benefits]
RECOMMENDATIONS: [Prioritized next steps and actions]
WORKFLOW_INTEGRATION: [If applicable, workflow handoff preparation]
```

### Multi-Role Analysis Output
```
ROLE_COORDINATION: [How perspectives were integrated]
PERSPECTIVE_INSIGHTS: [Key insights from each role]
SYNTHESIS_RESULTS: [Combined perspective analysis]
CONFLICT_RESOLUTION: [How role conflicts were addressed]
COMPREHENSIVE_COVERAGE: [Confirmation all aspects considered]
```

## Quality Standards

### Effective Session Facilitation
- **Clear Structure** → Follow defined phases and maintain session flow
- **Inclusive Participation** → Ensure all perspectives are heard and valued  
- **Creative Environment** → Maintain judgment-free ideation atmosphere
- **Productive Tension** → Balance creativity with practical constraints
- **Actionable Outcomes** → Generate concrete next steps and recommendations

### Perspective Integration
- **Authentic Representation** → Accurately channel each role's mental models
- **Balanced Coverage** → Give appropriate attention to all perspectives
- **Constructive Synthesis** → Combine insights into stronger solutions
- **Conflict Navigation** → Address perspective tensions constructively
- **Comprehensive Analysis** → Ensure no critical aspects are overlooked

### Documentation Quality
- **Structured Capture** → Organize insights and ideas systematically
- **Clear Communication** → Present complex ideas in accessible format
- **Decision Support** → Provide frameworks for evaluating options
- **Implementation Ready** → Prepare outputs for next development phases
- **Traceability** → Maintain clear links between ideas and analysis

## Integration Guidelines

### With Brainstorming Principles
This framework works in conjunction with @~/.claude/workflows/brainstorming-principles.md which defines:
- Project structure establishment
- Session initialization requirements
- Directory creation protocols
- Agent coordination standards

### With Role Commands
Each role-specific brainstorm command implements this framework within their domain context:
- Applies appropriate techniques for their perspective
- Uses mode selection based on problem type
- Follows documentation standards
- Maintains quality criteria

This framework provides the common foundation for all brainstorming activities while allowing role-specific customization and focus.
