Analyze implementation patterns and code structure:

## Required Analysis:
1. Identify common code patterns and architectural decisions
2. Extract reusable utilities and shared components
3. Document existing conventions and coding standards
4. Assess pattern consistency and identify anti-patterns
5. Suggest improvements and optimization opportunities

## Output Requirements:
- Specific file:line references for all findings
- Code snippets demonstrating identified patterns
- Clear recommendations for pattern improvements
- Standards compliance assessment

Focus on actionable insights and concrete implementation guidance.
