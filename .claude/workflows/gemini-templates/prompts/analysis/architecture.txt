Analyze system architecture and design decisions:

## Required Analysis:
1. Identify main architectural patterns and design principles
2. Map module dependencies and component relationships
3. Assess integration points and data flow patterns
4. Evaluate scalability and maintainability aspects
5. Document architectural trade-offs and design decisions

## Output Requirements:
- Architectural diagrams or textual descriptions
- Dependency mapping with specific file references
- Integration point documentation with examples
- Scalability assessment and bottleneck identification

Focus on high-level design patterns and system-wide architectural concerns.
