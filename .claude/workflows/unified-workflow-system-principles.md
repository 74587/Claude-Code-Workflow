# Workflow System Architecture

## Overview
**Foundation**: @./core-principles.md

This document defines the technical system architecture, component relationships, and coordination mechanisms that implement the core workflow principles.

## System Components

### Session Management
**Multi-Session Architecture**: Supports concurrent sessions with single active session pattern
**Registry System**: Global registry tracks all sessions, commands inherit active session context
**State Management**: Individual session state with phase-aware progress tracking

**Technical Details**: @./session-management-principles.md

### File Structure System
**Progressive Structure**: Scales from minimal structure for simple tasks to comprehensive organization for complex workflows
**Complexity Levels**: Three levels (0-2) with automatic structure generation based on task count and scope
**Standard Templates**: Consistent directory layouts and file naming across all complexity levels

**Technical Details**: @./file-structure-standards.md

### Chat and Summary Management
**Interaction Documentation**: Gemini CLI sessions automatically saved and cross-referenced with planning documents
**Task Summaries**: Comprehensive documentation of completed work with cross-referencing to implementation plans
**Integration**: Chat insights inform planning, summaries provide audit trail

**Technical Details**: @./file-structure-standards.md

### Task Management System
**Hierarchical Task Schema**: JSON-based task definitions with up to 3 levels of decomposition
**State Coordination**: Bidirectional sync between JSON task files, TODO_LIST.md, and workflow session
**Agent Integration**: Agent assignment based on task type with context preparation
**Progress Tracking**: Real-time progress calculation with dependency management

**Technical Details**: @./task-management-principles.md

### Document Generation Rules
**Complexity-Based Generation**: Automatic document creation based on task count, scope, and complexity
**Progressive Templates**: Standard document templates that scale with workflow complexity
**Auto-trigger Logic**: Conditional document generation based on predefined thresholds

**Technical Details**: @./task-decomposition-integration.md

### Brainstorming Integration
**Context Preservation**: Multi-role brainstorming analysis automatically integrated into planning documents
**Cross-Referencing**: Task context includes references to relevant brainstorming insights
**Synthesis Integration**: Planning documents synthesize brainstorming outputs into actionable strategies

**Technical Details**: @./file-structure-standards.md

## Coordination System

### Data Ownership and Synchronization
**Clear Ownership**: Each document type owns specific data with defined synchronization rules
**Bidirectional Sync**: Automatic synchronization between JSON task files, TODO_LIST.md, and planning documents
**Conflict Resolution**: Prioritized resolution system based on ownership, timestamps, and consistency

**Technical Details**: @./task-management-principles.md

## Command Integration

### Embedded Workflow Logic
**Workflow Commands**: Session management, planning, and implementation with embedded document generation
**Task Commands**: Task creation, breakdown, execution, and status with automatic synchronization
**Manual Tools**: Maintenance operations for edge cases and manual intervention

**Technical Details**: See individual command documentation

## Implementation Flow

**Workflow Phases**: Session initialization â†’ [Optional brainstorming] â†’ Planning â†’ Implementation â†’ Review
**Progressive Complexity**: Structure and documentation automatically scale with task complexity
**Cross-Integration**: Real-time synchronization across all system components

## Quality Control

**Auto-Validation**: Task ID consistency, document references, progress calculations, cross-file integrity
**Error Recovery**: Automatic recovery strategies with manual fallback for complex conflicts
**Data Integrity**: Comprehensive validation and consistency checks across all workflow components
