# Brainstorming System Principles

## Core Philosophy
**"Diverge first, then converge"** - Generate multiple solutions from diverse perspectives, then synthesize and prioritize.

## Creative Techniques Reference

### SCAMPER Method
- **Substitute**: What can be substituted or replaced?
- **Combine**: What can be combined or merged?
- **Adapt**: What can be adapted from elsewhere?
- **Modify**: What can be magnified, minimized, or modified?
- **Put to other uses**: How else can this be used?
- **Eliminate**: What can be removed or simplified?
- **Reverse**: What can be rearranged or reversed?

### Six Thinking Hats
- **White Hat**: Facts, information, data
- **Red Hat**: Emotions, feelings, intuition
- **Black Hat**: Critical judgment, caution, problems
- **Yellow Hat**: Optimism, benefits, positive thinking
- **Green Hat**: Creativity, alternatives, new ideas
- **Blue Hat**: Process control, meta-thinking

### Additional Techniques
- **Mind Mapping**: Visual idea exploration and connection
- **Brainwriting**: Silent idea generation and building
- **Random Word**: Stimulus-based creative thinking
- **Assumption Challenging**: Question fundamental assumptions

## Analysis Modes

### Creative Mode (Default)
- **Focus**: Innovation and unconventional solutions
- **Approach**: Emphasize divergent thinking, "what if" scenarios, assumption challenging

### Analytical Mode
- **Focus**: Evidence-based systematic problem-solving
- **Approach**: Structured analysis, root cause analysis, logical reasoning

### Strategic Mode
- **Focus**: Long-term strategic positioning
- **Approach**: Systems thinking, competitive dynamics, market forces

## Documentation Standards

### Session Output Format
```
CHALLENGE_DEFINITION: Clear problem space definition
KEY_INSIGHTS: Major discoveries and patterns
TOP_CONCEPTS: 5 most promising solutions with analysis
PERSPECTIVE_SYNTHESIS: Integration of role-based insights
FEASIBILITY_ASSESSMENT: Technical and resource evaluation
RECOMMENDATIONS: Prioritized next steps and actions
```

### Idea Documentation
For each significant concept:
- Core mechanism and description
- Multi-perspective implications
- Feasibility assessment (technical, resource, timeline)
- Impact potential and success metrics
- Implementation considerations
- Risk assessment and mitigation

## Quality Standards

### Session Excellence
- **Clear Structure**: Follow Explore → Ideate → Converge → Document phases
- **Inclusive Participation**: Ensure all perspectives are valued
- **Creative Environment**: Maintain judgment-free ideation atmosphere
- **Actionable Outcomes**: Generate concrete next steps

### Perspective Integration
- **Authentic Representation**: Accurately channel each role's mental models
- **Constructive Synthesis**: Combine insights into stronger solutions
- **Conflict Navigation**: Address perspective tensions constructively
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Ensure no critical aspects overlooked
