# Project Integration Rules

## Learning the Codebase

- Find 3 similar features/components
- Identify common patterns and conventions
- Use same libraries/utilities when possible
- Follow existing test patterns

## Tooling

- Use project's existing build system
- Use project's test framework
- Use project's formatter/linter settings
- Don't introduce new tools without strong justification

## Content Uniqueness Rules

- **Each layer owns its abstraction level** - no content sharing between layers
- **Reference, don't duplicate** - point to other layers, never copy content
- **Maintain perspective** - each layer sees the system at its appropriate scale
- **Avoid implementation creep** - higher layers stay architectural
