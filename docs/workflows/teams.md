/ccw "QA 团队: 质量保障支付流程"

# Team-based workflows
/ccw "team brainstorm: 新功能想法"
/ccw "team issue: 修复登录超时"
/ccw "team testing: 测试覆盖率提升"
```

### Direct Skill Invocation

```javascript
// Programmatic invocation
Skill(skill="team-lifecycle-v5", args="Build user authentication system")
Skill(skill="team-planex", args="Implement OAuth2 with concurrent planning")
Skill(skill="team-quality-assurance", args="Quality audit of payment system")

// With mode selection
Skill(skill="workflow-plan", args="--mode replan")
```

### Via Task Tool (for agent invocation)

```javascript
// Spawn team worker agent
Task({
  subagent_type: "team-worker",
  description: "Spawn executor worker",
  team_name: "my-team",
  name: "executor",
  run_in_background: true,
  prompt: `## Role Assignment
role: executor
session: D:/project/.workflow/.team/my-session
session_id: my-session
team_name: my-team
requirement: Implement user authentication
inner_loop: true`
})
```

## Team Skill Architecture

### Version Evolution

| Version | Architecture | Status |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| **v5** | team-worker (dynamic roles) | **Latest** |
| v4 | 5-phase lifecycle with inline discuss | Stable |
| v3 | 3-phase lifecycle | Legacy |
| v2 | Generic coordination | Obsolete |

### v5 Team Worker Architecture

The latest architecture uses the `team-worker` agent with dynamic role assignment based on phase prefixes:

| Phase | Prefix | Role |
|-------|--------|------|
| Analysis | ANALYSIS | doc-analyst |
| Draft | DRAFT | doc-writer |
| Planning | PLAN | planner |
| Implementation | IMPL | executor (code-developer, tdd-developer, etc.) |
| Testing | TEST | tester (test-fix-agent, etc.) |
| Review | REVIEW | reviewer |

### Role Types

| Type | Prefix | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| **Orchestrator** | COORD | Manages workflow, coordinates agents |
| **Lead** | SPEC, IMPL, TEST | Leads phase, delegates to workers |
| **Worker** | Various | Executes specific tasks |

## Workflow Patterns

### Wave Pipeline (team-planex)

```
Wave 1: Plan ──────────────────────────────────┐
         ↓                                      │
Wave 2: Exec  ←────────────────────────────────┘
         ↓
Wave 3: Plan → Exec → Plan → Exec → ...
```

Concurrent planning and execution - executor works on wave N while planner plans wave N+1.

### Generator-Critic Loop (team-iterdev)

```
Generator → Output → Critic → Feedback → Generator
                ↓
            Integrator → Validator
```

Iterative improvement through feedback cycles.

### CP-9 Dual-Track (team-uidesign)

```
Design Track:  Designer → Tokens → Style
                           ↓
Implementation Track:        Developer → Components
                           ↓
                      Reviewer → Verify
```

Design and implementation proceed in parallel tracks.

### 5-Phase Lifecycle (team-lifecycle-v4)

```
1. Spec Planning (coordinator + spec-lead)
2. Architecture Design (architect)
3. Implementation Planning (impl-lead + dev team)
4. Test Planning (test-lead + qa-analyst)
5. Execution & Verification (all roles)
```

Linear progression through all lifecycle phases.
