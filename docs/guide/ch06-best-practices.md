### 6.2.4 Feedback Format

```markdown
## Review Results

### Issues
1. **[HIGH]** SQL injection risk
   - Location: `src/auth/login.ts:45`
   - Recommendation: Use parameterized queries

2. **[MEDIUM]** Performance issue
   - Location: `src/utils/cache.ts:78`
   - Recommendation: Use LRU cache

### Suggestions
1. Naming optimization: `data` → `userData`
2. Module separation: Consider extracting Auth logic independently

### Approval Conditions
- [ ] Fix HIGH issues
- [ ] Consider MEDIUM suggestions
