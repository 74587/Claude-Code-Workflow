| **No insight visibility** | Can't see analysis results | Dedicated page for discovery sessions |
| **Stale data** | Manual refresh required | Auto-refresh every 3 seconds |
| **Unstructured findings** | Hard to navigate results | Split pane with session list and findings detail |
| **No export** | Can't save findings | Export all or selected findings |
| **Missing context** | Don't know related issues | Link findings to related issues |

| **Select session** | Click a discovery card in the left panel to load its findings |
| **Filter findings** | Use filter controls in the findings detail panel to narrow results |
| **Export all findings** | Click "Export All" to download all findings for current session |
| **Export selected findings** | Select specific findings, click "Export Selected" |
| **Navigate to issue** | Click on a finding to open related issue in Issues panel |
