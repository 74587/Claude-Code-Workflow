## Lifecycle Skills

### team-lifecycle

**One-Liner**: Full lifecycle orchestrator — spawn-wait-close pipeline for spec/implementation/test

**Triggers**:
```shell
/team-lifecycle <task-description>
```

**Features**:
- 5-phase pipeline: requirements clarification → session initialization → task chain creation → pipeline coordination → completion report
- **Inline discuss**: Production roles (analyst, writer, reviewer) inline invoke discuss subagents, reducing spec pipeline from 12 beats to 6
- **Shared explore cache**: All agents share centralized `explorations/` directory, eliminating duplicate codebase exploration
- **Fast-advance spawning**: Immediately spawn next linear successor after agent completion
- **Consensus severity routing**: Discussion results routed through HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW severity levels

**Agent Registry**:
| Agent | Role | Mode |
|-------|------|------|
| analyst | Seed analysis, context collection, DISCUSS-001 | 2.8 Inline Subagent |
| writer | Documentation generation, DISCUSS-002 to DISCUSS-005 | 2.8 Inline Subagent |
| planner | Multi-angle exploration, plan generation | 2.9 Cached Exploration |
| executor | Code implementation | 2.1 Standard |
| tester | Test-fix loop | 2.3 Deep Interaction |
| reviewer | Code review + spec quality, DISCUSS-006 | 2.8 Inline Subagent |
| architect | Architecture consultation (on-demand) | 2.1 Standard |
| fe-developer | Frontend implementation | 2.1 Standard |
| fe-qa | Frontend QA, GC loop | 2.3 Deep Interaction |

**Pipeline Definition**:
```plaintext
Spec-only (6 beats):
  RESEARCH-001(+D1) → DRAFT-001(+D2) → DRAFT-002(+D3) → DRAFT-003(+D4) → DRAFT-004(+D5) → QUALITY-001(+D6)

Impl-only (3 beats):
  PLAN-001 → IMPL-001 → TEST-001 || REVIEW-001

Full-lifecycle (9 beats):
  [Spec pipeline] → PLAN-001 → IMPL-001 → TEST-001 || REVIEW-001
```

**Beat Cycle**:
```plaintext
event (phase advance / user resume)
      ↓
  [Orchestrator]
      +-- read state file
      +-- find ready tasks
      +-- spawn agent(s)
      +-- wait(agent_ids, timeout)
      +-- process results
      +-- update state file
      +-- close completed agents
      +-- fast-advance: spawn next
      +-- yield (wait for next event)
```

**Session Directory**:
```plaintext
.workflow/.team/TLS-<slug>-<date>/
├── team-session.json           # Pipeline state
├── spec/                       # Specification artifacts

```

### parallel-dev-cycle

**One-Liner**: Multi-agent parallel development cycle — requirements analysis, exploration planning, code development, validation

**Triggers**:
```shell
/parallel-dev-cycle TASK="Implement feature"
/parallel-dev-cycle --cycle-id=cycle-v1-20260122-abc123
/parallel-dev-cycle --auto TASK="Add OAuth"
```

**Features**:
- 4 specialized workers: RA (requirements), EP (exploration), CD (development), VAS (validation)
- Main process inline orchestration (no separate orchestrator agent)
- Each agent maintains one main document (complete rewrite per iteration) + auxiliary log (append)
- Automatically archive old versions to `history/` directory

**Workers**:
| Worker | Main Document | Auxiliary Log |
|--------|---------------|---------------|
| RA | requirements.md | changes.log |
| EP | exploration.md, architecture.md, plan.json | changes.log |
| CD | implementation.md, issues.md | changes.log, debug-log.ndjson |
| VAS | summary.md, test-results.json | changes.log |

**Shared Discovery Board**:
- All agents share real-time discovery board `coordination/discoveries.ndjson`
- Agents read at start, append discoveries during work
- Eliminates redundant codebase exploration

**Session Structure**:
```plaintext
{projectRoot}/.workflow/.cycle/
├── {cycleId}.json                     # Main state file
├── {cycleId}.progress/
│   ├── ra/                         # RA agent artifacts
│   │   ├── requirements.md        # Current version (complete rewrite)
│   │   ├── changes.log           # NDJSON full history (append)
│   │   └── history/              # Archived snapshots
│   ├── ep/                         # EP agent artifacts
│   ├── cd/                         # CD agent artifacts
│   ├── vas/                        # VAS agent artifacts
│   └── coordination/               # Coordination data
│       ├── discoveries.ndjson      # Shared discovery board
│       ├── timeline.md             # Execution timeline
│       └── decisions.log            # Decision log
```

**Execution Flow**:
```plaintext
Phase 1: Session initialization
    ↓ cycleId, state, progressDir

Phase 2: Agent execution (parallel)
    ├─ Spawn RA → EP → CD → VAS
    └─ Wait for all agents to complete

Phase 3: Result aggregation & iteration
    ├─ Parse PHASE_RESULT
    ├─ Detect issues (test failures, blockers)
    ├─ Issues AND iteration < max?
    │   ├─ Yes → Send feedback, loop back to Phase 2
    │   └─ No → Proceed to Phase 4
    └─ Output: parsedResults, iteration status

Phase 4: Completion and summary
    ├─ Generate unified summary report
    ├─ Update final state
    ├─ Close all agents
    └─ Output: Final cycle report
```

**Version Control**:
- 1.0.0: Initial cycle → 1.x.0: Each iteration (minor version increment)
- Each iteration: Archive old version → Complete rewrite → Append changes.log

## Best Practices

1. **Choose the right team type**:
   - Full lifecycle → `team-lifecycle`
   - Parallel development → `parallel-dev-cycle`
   - Collaborative analysis → `analyze-with-file`

2. **Leverage Inline Discuss**: Production roles inline invoke discuss subagents, reducing orchestration overhead

3. **Shared Cache**: Utilize shared exploration cache to avoid duplicate codebase exploration

4. **Fast-Advance**: Linear successor tasks automatically skip orchestrator, improving efficiency

5. **Consensus Routing**: Understand consensus routing behavior for different severity levels

## Usage Examples

```bash
# Full lifecycle development
/team-lifecycle "Build user authentication API"

# Parallel development
/parallel-dev-cycle TASK="Implement notifications"

# Collaborative analysis
/analyze-with-file TOPIC="How to optimize database queries?"

# Brainstorming
/brainstorm-with-file TOPIC="Design payment system"

# Debugging
/debug-with-file BUG="System crashes intermittently"

# Test-fix
/workflow-test-fix-cycle "Unit tests failing"
```
