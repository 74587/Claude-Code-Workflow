## Team Collaboration Skills

### Team Architecture Models

Claude_dms3 supports two team architecture models:

1. **team-coordinate** (Universal Coordinator)
   - Only coordinator is built-in
   - All worker roles are dynamically generated at runtime
   - Supports dynamic teams for any task type

2. **team-lifecycle-v5** (Full Lifecycle Team)
   - Based on team-worker agent architecture
   - All workers share the same agent definition
   - Role-specific Phase 2-4 loaded from markdown specs

### Team Types Comparison

| Team Type | Roles | Use Case |
|-----------|-------|----------|
| **team-coordinate** | coordinator + dynamic roles | General task orchestration |
| **team-lifecycle** | 9 predefined roles | Spec→Impl→Test→Review |
| **team-planex** | planner + executor | Plan-and-execute in parallel |
| **team-review** | coordinator + scanner + reviewer + fixer | Code review and fix |
| **team-testing** | coordinator + strategist + generator + executor + analyst | Test coverage |

## Workflow Skills

### Workflow Levels

| Level | Name | Workflow | Use Case |
|-------|------|----------|----------|
| Level 1 | Lite-Lite-Lite | lite-plan | Super simple quick tasks |
| Level 2 | Rapid | plan → execute | Bug fixes, simple features |
| Level 2.5 | Rapid-to-Issue | plan → issue:new | From rapid planning to Issue |
| Level 3 | Coupled | plan → execute | Complex features (plan+execute+review+test) |
| Level 4 | Full | brainstorm → plan → execute | Exploratory tasks |
| With-File | Documented exploration | analyze/brainstorm/debug-with-file | Multi-CLI collaborative analysis |

## Memory Management Skills

### Memory Types

| Type | Format | Use Case |
|------|--------|----------|
| **Session compression** | Structured text | Full context save after long conversations |
| **Quick notes** | Notes with tags | Quick capture of ideas and insights |

### Memory Storage

# Quick task
/workflow-lite-plan "Fix login bug"

# Full development
/workflow-plan "Add user notifications"
/workflow-execute

# TDD development
/workflow-tdd "Implement payment processing"

### 3. Use Memory Management

```bash
# Compress session
/memory-capture compact

# Quick note
/memory-capture tip "Use Redis for rate limiting" --tag config
```

### 4. Code Review

```bash
# Full review (6 dimensions)
/review-code src/auth/**

# Review specific dimensions
/review-code --dimensions=sec,perf src/api/
```

### 5. Meta-Skills

# Brainstorm
/brainstorm "Design payment system" --count 3

# Get help
/ccw "Add JWT authentication"
```

## Best Practices

1. **Team Selection**:
   - General tasks → `team-coordinate`
   - Full features → `team-lifecycle`
   - Issue batching → `team-planex`
   - Code review → `team-review`
   - Test coverage → `team-testing`

2. **Workflow Selection**:
   - Super simple → `workflow-lite-plan`
   - Complex features → `workflow-plan` → `workflow-execute`
   - TDD → `workflow-tdd-plan`
   - Test fixes → `workflow-test-fix`

3. **Memory Management**:
   - Use `memory-capture compact` after long conversations
   - Use `memory-capture tip` for quick idea capture
   - Regularly use `memory-manage full` to merge and compress

4. **Code Review**:
   - Read specification documents completely before reviewing
   - Use `--dimensions` to specify focus areas
   - Quick scan first to identify high-risk areas, then deep review

5. **Meta-Skills**:
   - Use `spec-generator` for complete spec packages
   - Use `brainstorm` for multi-perspective analysis
   - Use `ccw-help` to find appropriate commands
